# Milky Mist Customer Segmentation

This project applies **K-Means clustering** to Milky Mist customer survey data to uncover distinct customer groups and generate actionable insights for targeted marketing.

##  Project Overview
- **Objective:** Identify consumer segments based on survey responses.
- **Methodology:** 
  1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing (handling missing values, normalization)
  2. Determining optimal number of clusters using **Elbow Method**
  3. Applying **K-Means Clustering**
  4. Visualizing and profiling each cluster to extract insights
- **Outcome:** 5 unique customer clusters, each with specific characteristics and buying preferences.

##  Repository Structure
- `data/` â€“ Cleaned dataset (RR.csv)
- `notebooks/` â€“ Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step clustering code
- `results/` â€“ Visualizations, cluster summaries, and insights
